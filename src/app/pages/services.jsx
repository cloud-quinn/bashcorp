                    We've got years of experience in both <strong>AngularJS</strong> and 
                    <strong>React</strong>, built on both open-source platforms such as
                    <strong>NodeJS</strong> and <strong>Microsoft IIS 8</strong>.

                    We also have many years experience delivering excellent, exciting and
                    new applications in the Microsoft .Net stack: both <strong>Umbraco</strong> 
                    and <strong>Sitecore 8</strong> websites for some really large organisations.

                <h2><a id="rates"></a>Rates</h2>
                <p>Our rates depend on what you need and where you need us- remote working is a lot cheaper for us than
                on-site working, plus it helps to save the environment <span className="green">â™»ï¸Ž</span>.  We can easily reach Manchester,
                Birmingham, Nottingham and can get to Liverpool and London.</p>
                <p>Generally, our day rate is between &pound;300-400 for remote and &pound;400-500 on-site; 
                though that's only a guide.  <ExternalLink url="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ir35-find-out-if-it-applies" text="IR35" />, 
                distance and a whole bunch of stuff go into it.  Give us a call and we'll negotiate ðŸ˜€.</p>
